Release notes for version 0.91 of landell
=========================================

This software is still under development.

Differences between version 0.90 and 0.91:
=========================================

-- Distributes scalable icon.
-- Uses decodebin2 for HTTP input source.
-- Uses livekeeper element for HTTP input, so it does not lock the
pipeline when it disconnects.

Known issues:
=============

- Stopping the pipeline might loose frames not recorded;
- The software may have problems loading old configuration files. To fix that,
  remove the sources or edit the file by hand adding the missing
  configurations.
