  an entry in the menu for SLTV.

  than the current doesn't work)

========================================

- Support for multiple simultaneous outputs;
- Each output has its own configurations, including encoding configurations;
- Support for lenny versions of gstreamer and python;
- Many cosmetic changes in interface;
- Removed encoding UI, meaning all outputs use ogg theora + vorbis;
