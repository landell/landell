Release notes for version 0.7 of sltv
=====================================

This software is still under development.

Differences between version 0.6.1 and 0.7:
==========================================

- Volume setting
- Audiorate configuration
- Audio encoding configuration (bitrate and quality)
- Improved main UI
- Optional recording of raw DV file
- Split between encoding and output, allowing one encoding to be used for
  several outputs
- Font and position config for text overlay
- Accepting decimals in framerate and converting them to a proper fraction
  (fixes bug #21)

Known issues:
=============

- File source might not work with multiple sources;
