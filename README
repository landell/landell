About:
======

  Landell is an audio and video streamer that receives streams from sources
  and sends a stream using icecast. It has a graphical interface that
  shows preview and allows applying dynamic effects and configuring stream.

  The name 'Landell' [0] is an homage to the Father Roberto Landell de Moura
  (January 21, 1861â€“June 30, 1928). He was a Brazilian Roman Catholic
  priest and inventor who publicly demonstrated a radio broadcast of the
  human voice on June 3, 1900.
